# East Buy counts the cost of candor after share rout

By Molly Wen

Oversharing in online conversations, or being candid about challenges, can inflict a business cost. Chinese e-commerce platform East Buy Holding Ltd. has been learning this public relations lesson after unguarded comments from two of its most prominent figures triggered a stock sell-off.

The investor relations nightmare began on May 31, when Yu Minhong, the CEO of East Buy and founder of its parent company New Oriental, took part in a livestreaming chat with an industry buddy. Discussing business challenges, Yu told his Wumart counterpart that he was in no position to offer advice as East Buy had been dealing with its own "mess". 

In a radio program two days later, East Buy's star anchor, Dong Yuhui, waded into hot water with some frank reflections on his job. Dong said he had never to this day enjoyed promoting goods in livestreamed broadcasts.

Investors are paying close attention to Dong as a sales driver, concerned about East Buy's prospects under the new relationship. Dong's sales through the new channel still feed into the company's operating revenue, but East Buy's primary platform is losing both followers and sales, a sign of waning appeal.
